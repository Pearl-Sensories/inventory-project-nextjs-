          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ðŸŒ¿ Natural Textures & Earthy Tones</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most defining trends this year is the use of organic materials like rattan, teak, bamboo, and linen.
            These elements not only blend beautifully with the surrounding landscape but also create a sense of calm and authenticity.
            <br />
            <span className="italic">Pro Tip:</span> Pair walnut or caramel-toned frames with off-white cushions for a warm, grounded aesthetic.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ðŸ§± Modular & Multi-Functional Pieces</h2>
          <p>
            With more people entertaining at home, modular outdoor seating has become a staple.
            These versatile pieces can be rearranged to fit any layout or occasion â€” from cozy conversations to festive gatherings.
            <br />
            <span className="italic">Look for:</span> Sofas with detachable sections, nesting coffee tables, or ottomans that double as storage.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ðŸŒ… Indoor-Outdoor Blending</h2>
          <p>
            Bringing indoor comfort outside is the ultimate luxury. Plush seating, weather-resistant throws, and decorative lighting are blurring the line between your living room and your patio.
            <br />
            <span className="italic">Try this:</span> Add soft accent pillows in slate gray or taupe to complement the warmth of your wooden furniture.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ðŸ•¯ Statement Lighting & Accessories</h2>
          <p>
            From lanterns to string lights and sculptural lamps, lighting is now a design focal point outdoors. Ambient lighting not only elevates the mood but also makes your space more usable after dark.
            <br />
            <span className="italic">Accent it with:</span> Metal finishes like bronze or matte black for a modern, elegant feel.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ðŸŒ¸ Sustainable, Durable Designs</h2>
          <p>
            Eco-conscious furniture made from recycled materials or sustainably harvested wood is not just a trend â€” it's a lifestyle.
            These pieces are built to last and support a more mindful way of living.

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ðŸ“¦ Compact Comfort for Small Spaces</h2>
          <p>
            Even the smallest balconies can become a sanctuary. Bistro tables, foldable chairs, and wall-mounted planters are ideal for tight areas without compromising style.
            <br />
            <span className="italic">Design Tip:</span> Use vertical space to layer your look â€” think shelves, hanging lanterns, and plant ladders.
